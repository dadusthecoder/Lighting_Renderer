zÔªø# üåå OpenGL Experimental Renderer

This project is an **experimental renderer** built with **C++ and OpenGL**, created as a personal learning journey into the world of modern graphics programming and real-time rendering pipelines.

The long-term goal is to evolve this project into a **Physically Based Renderer (PBR)** from scratch. For now, it serves as a sandbox for experimenting with rendering techniques, shaders, and scene management systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Project

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 (or later)
- CMake (optional if using VS solution directly)
- OpenGL-compatible GPU

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repo:
   bash: git clone https://github.com/dadusthecoder/opengl2.git

2. Open the .sln file in Visual Studio 2022.
  - Make sure the following directories are linked properly using vcpkg or you can link them manully:
  - /Dependencies ( GLFW,GLEW,Assimp ,glm , imGui)
  ## resources
  - /res (Shaders, models) 

 3. Build and Run.
 

### Controls and UI
  - Use mouse and WASD keys to navigate the camera.
  - Use the ImGui panel to:
  - Change model position, rotation, scale
  - Toggle gravity
  - Change light position and color
  - Reload shaders or models in real-time
